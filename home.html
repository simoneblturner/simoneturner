        My name is Simone Turner and I am a current junior majoring
         in Data Analytics in the School of Information at University 
         of Michigan. While I am a data science major, I am studying 
         the intersection between people, information, and technology. 
         This allows me to tackle problems through a wider lens and 
         strive for solutions in a more socially responsible way. 
         In order to further inform my approach to studying data 
         and technology, I am minoring in Political Science. I am
          passionate about the growing data industry in the infinite 
          applications and uses of big data in every industry today. 
          I thrive when I work through problems on a close knit team. 
          In one of my classes this semester I am building a database 
          in a small group using sql for the big ten schools. 
          Even though we are working virtually, bouncing ideas 
          off one another on Zoom in real time is the most efficient
          and effective way to build our final product. I enjoy 
          talking through my code and bouncing ideas off my peers.
